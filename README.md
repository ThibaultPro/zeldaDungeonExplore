We developed an RPG game on the MVC model using Qt framework. 

The Game was developed using Qt 5.15 and opencv4

We experienced some trouble with opencv functions when building the project on mac. 

If you plan to build it yourself and don't have opencv installed, we recommend you this tutorial to install opencv 4 and integrate it to a Qt application: 


Once installed, uncheck "shadow build" in your build settings to prevent errors from happening during build process. 

Here  is what final result should look like :

The game uses procedural map generation to create always more levels. See how many teleporters you can take, the exploration is limitless!

Have fun with zDE!
